            <h2>Open Source Web Development</h2>
            <p>This is program I chose to enter the world of programming. THe truth is, I wanted to learn all about programming, bu this particular program caught my attention because of a few reasons. Based on the research I did, Open Source Programming requires a lot of <strong>problem solving</strong>. In addition, in this program, programming with Python and Ruby will be taught which both are languages that I am interested in. I am especially lokking forward to learning Python, because Python is one of the main languages used in the AI field of study.</p>
            <h2>Toastmasters</h2>
            <p>Toastmasters is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of studying in ITD. It is a basically a public speaking club, in which a group of around 40 people gather around every week to practice public speaking by giving speeches about various topics. I believe Toastmasters is an important part of my education, because <strong>public speaking and communication</strong> are aspects that should be constantly improved. Good communication skill can help people both in personal and professional life, which is an aspect Toastmasters continously try to improve.</p>

            <h3><em>Feb 2018 - Jan 2019</em></h3>
            <h2>Studies</h2>
            <p>I graduated from highschool in Gleneagle. I have to say, I never expected to spend the last year of high school in anywhere outside of Iran. It was a very tough period of my life, but I am proud to come out of it as successful as possible. Being away from my family and friends did not stop me from trying to achieve my goals, in fact I managed to get GPA of 4.0 upon graduation, an achievement that I am really proud of. I feel like experiencing this level hardship allowed me to become more <strong>flexible</strong> and more <strong>goal-oriented</strong>, two aspects that I believe are cruicial in a field of occupation.</p>

            <p>Con-X leadership class was a part of Gleneagle that I could explore my extra-curriculuar capabilities. We were basically a club in which we gathered around and organized events in school and we were in charge of various activities. As a part of this class, I and six other students decided to organize an event called "Talk To Me" as a <strong>teamwork</strong>. The goal of the event was to raise awareness about Youth Menal Health and help remove the stigma around it. This is an event that I am particularly proud to be a part of for several reasons. First, I get the chance to work with some very talented group of people, and throughout the event, no matter what stage, we were successful in maintaining a very positive group dynamic. In addition, youth mental health is not talked about much in many areas, however we took part in tackling an issue that we considered to be important. Moreover, by organizing this event, not only we raised awareness about the topic, but we also gave a voice to students to open up about their experiences. All of these make this event really special to me.
