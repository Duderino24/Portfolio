                <h2><em>Feb 2018 - August 2018</em></h2>
                <p>I came to Canada about 2 years ago. When I arrived here I was fairly proficient at English language, I was 17 so I could take care of myself, and I had general familiarity with the Canadian culture through social media and TV. Even so, I still struggled a lot to settle in the new environment, and faced many issues, both financially and emotionally. The thought that there are refugees that come here without any of the privileges I had, and even without their own choice was truly terrifying to me. ISSofBC gave me a chance to help those people in the small scale I could afford. I know that my work there was not anything heroic, but I believe it is with these small steps that a society can make a bigger change. I volunteered in ISS mainly as an administrator. My tasks included, but weer not limited to: communicating with facilitators and making sure they have everything they need Being a connection between the facilitators and the program coordinators, doing paperwork including recording feedback at the end of each session, and recording receipts to make sure our expense would not exceed the program’s budget. Overall I really enjoyed my time in ISS and I am proud that I could help, no matter how small the help was.</p>

                <p>Sexual Education is one of the most taboo topics in Iran. The government has for years ignored the problems, that arise as a result of lack of sexual education with non-persuasive arguments. In FHA, I am proud that I worked with a talented group of people to raise awareness about such topic. FHA is a member associate of the Planned Parenthood Federation and their goal is raising awareness about Health issues to help vulnerable groups such as women, youth and LGBTQ people. I was a member of the youth committee which had the job to organize and recruit volunteers from across the town. Other Tasks included coordinating volunteers, assissting events, and translating.</p>

                <h2><em>Sep 2018 - Oct 2018</em></h2>
                <p>Ever since I planned to come to Canada, one of the things that I was most excited about was the Film Festivals. As a film lover I was really happy that I could be a part of an event that was so important to the community. In addition it was a wonderful experience for me test my communication skills in an environemnt that required a lot of urgency and quick-decision making. Overall, I really enjoyed my time in VIFF and it was a wonderful learning experience.</p>

                <p>Tutouring Grade 9 students after a long day in school was tough. It made me realise how much patience is required for being a teacher. Even though it was tough, two things made me do it for about a year. First, the feeling that I got from helping another person to achieve their goal was truly satisfying. Second, it helped to develop my communication skills even further. I believe everyone should try tutouring at some point to reach a certain threshhold for patience.</p>

                <p>I am proficient in both English and Persian. This Bilingual skills has provided me with numerous opprtunities for translating since grade 8. In a way translating is like problem solving: you have to read the problem, analyze it for answers, structure that answer in a coherent way, and finally check to see if the answer is correct or not. In addition, translating required a lot of reading, which is an activity I reallt enjoy.</p>
