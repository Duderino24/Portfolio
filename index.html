            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>Ever since 9th grade I always dreamt about coming to Canada and study computer science. I never though the exact replica of my aspirations to come through, but here we are. My name is Arshia, I am 19, and I currently live in Coquitlam, BC. Right now I am studying in a private college called Institute of Technology Development of Canada (ITD) in the open source web development program. I really enjoy programming because it allows me to use my problem solving abilities to solve complex problems. In addition it requires a lot of patience which is something I possess almost all of the time. Other than programming my passions include movies, music, and writing. All of those allow me to take a break from complexities of everyday life and see things that I cannot realistically see in the actual world.</p>

            <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>
            <p>My career goals right now is very simple. I want to find an entry-level job realted to programming in order to gain experience working in an evironment that revolves completely around computer-realted tasks. Ultimately, I want to become and Artificail Intelligence Specialist. The mere thought of programming a machine for it to think like a human being is truly mesmerizing to me. I am also very passionate about working in companies with humanitarian-related cause. Currently, I am working for a company called Public Outreach. Basically what this company does is to collect money for various charities. I hope in the future, my work in whatever field can help people around the world.
                <br> As far as Personal goals go, right now I set a goal for myself to try to read 10 books per year and to go to the gym at least 4 times a week. Reading allows me to experience scenarios I may never experience in real life and learn new things about the world around. I believe if I don't leanr something new per day, no matter how small, I have wasted that day on nothing. Excercising also helps me in many aspects. It helps me become more healthy and helps to boost my confidence. I truly believe that there should always be a balance between personal, educational, and professional life; organizing my day to make room for all those activities allows me gain such balance.
